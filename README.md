## What is Vo-Coder?

Vo-Coder is a desktop workbench for working *with* AI agents — chatting, building software, running background jobs, controlling your homelab — without being married to any one AI vendor, and without paying frontier-model prices for every throwaway question.

The design follows one metaphor all the way down: the **tool shed**. The harness itself is deliberately lightweight — it holds the tools (file access, terminals, web search, vision, MCP servers, infrastructure drivers) and coordinates requests. The model is the engineer who walks into the shed and decides what to pick up. Models are interchangeable; the shed is yours.

**You talk to Vodo.** Vodo is the coordinator agent — the one face in front of every model. For each message, Vodo reads the task's actual demands — is this casual chat or a build request? does it need vision, tools, hard reasoning? — and routes it to the **cheapest model that's genuinely adequate**, scored from live provider pricing and real benchmark data (LMArena Elo, coding-weighted). "Make this look modern" in a project folder wakes a capable executor; "thanks!" costs a fraction of a cent. Every routed reply shows its reasoning and estimated cost, and per-project meters keep the spending honest. When you'd rather delegate to your own hand-built specialists — or pin one model forever — routing is a setting, not a religion.

And because an assistant should not be trapped in one window, Vodo works as one continuous entity across surfaces: the desktop chat, background **missions** running on schedules, your **Telegram** account when you're away from the machine — all sharing one **memory journal**, so "what was I working on last Monday?" has an answer no matter where you ask it.

Everything runs on your machine. API keys are encrypted with your OS keychain and go only to the providers you configured. Local models (Ollama, LM Studio) are first-class citizens, not an afterthought. Agents act through permission prompts — you see every file write and command before it happens.

## What's inside
<a id="whats-inside"></a>

**🤖 Six providers, one chat** — Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, xAI (Grok), Ollama, LM Studio. Keys live encrypted in your OS keychain. Grok also supports **subscription sign-in** (SuperGrok / X Premium) — no API key needed.

**🧭 Smart routing, your rules** — four modes: *Auto* (cheapest adequate model per message), *My agents first* (your specialist agents get matching work, Auto as fallback), *My agents only* (every turn lands on one of your agents), or *Off*. Every routed reply shows the reasoning and estimated cost.

**🛠 Agents with hands** — agents don't hand you instructions; they do the work. Workspace tools (list/read/write files, run commands) scoped to your project folder, gated by per-call permission prompts. Web search and page fetching are built into every session — no API key, no setup.

**📂 Point a chat at any folder** — attach any folder to a chat (no project needed) and the agent gets tools over it: browse, read, run, and *see*. Review a codebase, or catalog a folder of photos so you can find them later by feel — "the moody one," "the sunny beach shot."

**👁 Real eyes for any model** — `look_at_image` runs an image file through your vision model and hands the description back as text, so even a text-only coder can "see" a screenshot or photo. Camera **RAW** files (NEF, CR2/CR3, ARW, RAF, ORF, RW2, DNG, and 20+ more) open via their embedded preview. `file_identify` decodes camera/app naming schemes — which device shot each file, and the date baked into the name.

**🔍 One-click code review** — a Review button runs a real read-only pass over the folder, ranks findings by severity, and ends with proposed changes behind an **Approve / Revise / Don't accept** pill. Approve and the agent applies the edits and verifies them; decline and nothing is touched.

**🎨 Image generation in-chat** — point an image-output model at a prompt and the result renders inline *and* lands in the project's `designs/` folder.

**🚀 Missions** — background objectives Vodo pursues in its own isolated agent instances, one-shot or looping on a schedule. Missions run concurrently with your chats, so long work never blocks the conversation. Just ask: *"check my backups every hour and report problems."*

**📱 Telegram remote** — pair your own Telegram bot with a one-time code and talk to Vodo from anywhere: ask questions, launch missions, get run notifications, approve tool calls with inline buttons.

**🧠 Cross-everything memory** — a timestamped journal records activity across all projects, chats, missions, and tools. Ask Vodo *"what was I working on last Monday at 10pm?"* and it answers from the record. Pin durable facts any agent can recall.

**🗂 A memory bank per project** — every conversation is kept verbatim in a local SQLite archive, and distilled into a structured **map** (decisions, files, tasks, facts, and their links) you can browse and edit in the Memory view. Turn on **Smart context** and the window becomes a buffer over that map — a chat that once replayed 290k tokens a turn drops to a few thousand, with the full record always one search away.

**🎙 Voice** — push-to-talk and hands-free live chat. One-click whisper.cpp setup for fully offline speech-to-text. Text-to-speech through your system voice, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, or **any OpenAI-compatible endpoint** (Groq, local Kokoro, …) — replies are spoken sentence-by-sentence while the model is still writing.

**👀 Live code view** — watch agents build in real time: project tree with change states, per-line diffs, syntax highlighting, git-aware review. Select any code and ask for an explanation, a rethink, or a change — right where it is.

**🏗 Project scaffolding** — an 8-question setup (including the target platform: Windows/macOS/Linux desktop, Android, iOS, website, web app, server) generates a `PROJECT_CONFIG.md` that agents and tools treat as the project's north star. Beginners get every option explained; environment answers are remembered across projects.

**🖥 Infrastructure MCP** — a bundled, generalized infrastructure server: environment discovery plus a Proxmox driver (VMs, containers, snapshots, backups) behind read < write < destructive permission tiers. Works in any MCP client, not just Vo-Coder. Finding more tools is built in: search the official MCP registry and add servers with one click.

**📟 The essentials** — real PTY terminal with tabs, a live app preview that starts (and stops) your project's dev server and follows whichever project you're in, per-project + all-time usage tracking, auto-updates that keep your settings and keys.

**🛡 Built to not hang** — a silent or throttled model can't freeze a turn (a stall watchdog aborts it), Stop always interrupts even a wedged command, and long build-and-verify runs get room to finish instead of dying halfway. Three operating modes — **Auto** (autonomous), **Plan** (read-only, proposes a plan), **Manual** (approve every action).

## Install

Grab the latest installer from **[Releases](https://github.com/Vodozine/vo-coder/releases)** — Windows (auto-updating), macOS (Apple Silicon **and** Intel), and Linux AppImage.

**macOS:** open the DMG and drag Vo-Coder to Applications. Pick the **arm64** DMG for Apple Silicon (M-series) or the **x64** DMG for Intel. On first launch, **right-click the app → Open → Open** — a plain double-click is blocked because the build isn't notarized (no Apple Developer account behind it, just an open-source project). If macOS still says the app is *"damaged"*, run this once in Terminal and open it again:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Vo-Coder.app
```

On first run: add one API key (or start a local Ollama/LM Studio server — no key needed), and say hello to Vodo.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vodozine/vo-coder.git
cd vo-coder
npm install
npx tsc -b                      # compile workspace packages
npm run dev -w @vo-coder/desktop
```

Package an installer: `npm run dist:test -w @vo-coder/desktop` → `apps/desktop/release-local/`.

The monorepo: `apps/desktop` (Electron shell) plus independently publishable packages — `providers` (streaming adapters), `core` (agent loop, MCP client), `capability-registry` (catalog, pricing, routing), `scaffold`, `voice`, `infra-mcp`, `project-config`.

## License

MIT-style with one extra condition: **if you build on Vo-Coder, say so.** Fork it, extend it, ship it commercially, keep your changes closed — all fine. The only obligation for derived works is a visible *"Based on Vo-Coder"* credit. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). Branch it and take it to the next level.
